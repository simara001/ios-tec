#iOS Class


## Why should I take this class?

There are a lot of methodologies and ways in which new developers can start learning iOS. I have studied through different courses in different platforms like Coursera, Udemy, Stanford Online Courses, Apress Books, and all different kind of resources. So a fair question would be, how this course is different than the others? 

* **Is not everything about code: ** Reality is, if you are taking this class you have something on your mind, you want to build that idea that has been itching your head for some time. However, code is a really small part of the process. In this course we have special segments for how to validate ideas, mockup your ideas, design, best UX experiences, export your assets, guidelines, etc to help you go through it.
* **Practice the language when you need it:** Everyone puts as a general approach start learning the language right on the beginning and then use it. This might be really confusing for non developers or students with Computer Science's background. **Swift** is a really easy and dynamic language that is not as highly typed as Java for example, but is really safe if you use *optionals* correctly. We will use *Swift* when is needed, we will use design patterns when they are needed and we will use those concepts a lot... That's the best way of learning a language, using it and seeing it work with UIKit.
* **Challenges:** Because this program is for a course in one of the best schools in México, it needs to be evaluated. It contains challenges and homework designed to provide a deeper understanding of key concepts

## Do you need any help?

You will need a lot of help, no questions about it. At the beginning is harder because you don't know the correct keywords you need to have a clear answer on Google. You will have a lot of good friends, google, [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swift), [ray wenderlich](raywenderlich.com), and of course, your professor. 

I have created a course on [Slack](https://slack.com/), this is a **hard requirement** and it is not optional, that's the way in which we will communicate. For those of you how are not familiar with **Slack**, it is a chat application that supports *code snippets*, *images*, *groups*, *private messages*, it's free and it has support for Android/iOS devices and web. Create your account and add your email on the first discussion. That is actually your first Homework.

Don't under estimate the power of crowd knowledge. In case you have a question about a homework, challenge or a video, you can always contact me on the slack channel.

## My professor is not here, how do I deal with it?

Yes, I am not there, and yes if this is the first time you are trying something remotely it has some deeper implications. 

* **You need to be more responsible** I won't be there telling you to be quite and pay attention. Good thing you are not on high school anymore.
* **Ask questions: ** I will connect every day of the course, and you should ask as many questions as possible. 
* **Do your homework: ** Yes, I know! Life as a student is really hard, you have a lot of parties to go, you have a lot of courses, a lot of things to study (the day before the exams most of them), but if you want to get some juice out of this class, DO YOUR HOMEWORKS!
* **Watch the videos before the class: ** Because I am not going to be there, I will try to make the video at least 2 days before the class. It will be available for you to watch it and just come to the class so you can follow  the video easily. If you try to recreate what you will see in the video lessons the day of the class, good luck with that!
* **I will actually be there: ** I have a couple of trips planned, and probably I will plan a third one. This means that I will actually be there. We will have a couple of sessions on January and February, Fridays and Saturdays (yes I know, this might be difficult but you will live without your social commitments for those weekends).

#### When will I be there?

Professor is currently unavailable to travel outside US, as soon as this restriction changes he will confirm the dates in which he will be available.

## How am I going to be graded? 

We need to take a lot of factors for this class. We have 2 special events on this semester (Taller Vertical and Expo Ingenierías), and a final project. These are the specific grades:

### Evaluation

| Concept                       | Value |
| --                            | -- |
| Homework and challenges       | 30% |
| Final project                 | 65% |
| Taller Vertical               | 5% |
| Expo Ingenierías              | 7% |


#### Homework and challenges

Starting Week 2, you will have homework and challenges for each one of the week of the course. You should present them both before the end of the next week i.e. Homework and challenges for Week 2 should be delivered by the end of Week 3. Without excuses, if you miss the date you don't have the points for that week. 

#### Final project

| Concept                               | Value |
| --                                    | -- |
| First deliverable (Primer parcial)    | 5% |
| Second deliverable (Segundo parcial)  | 10% |
| Third deliverable (Tercer parcial)    | 15% |
| Final deliverable                     | 35% |

####Taller Vertical

**5%** of the final grade

#### Expo ingenierías

You can have up to **7** final points if you decide and fulfill the requirements for Expo Ingenierías. Team members should be 30 minutes before the event, have a presentation ready for the judges and general public. Finally, you SHOULD NOT work on your project during the fair.
